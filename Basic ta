Sure! Here's a Python script that imports the `pandas`, `pandas-datareader`, and `ta` (technical analysis) packages to calculate the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator for a stock:

```python
import pandas as pd
import pandas_datareader as pdr
from ta.trend import MACD

# Set the date range for the data you want to retrieve
start_date = '2020-01-01'
end_date = '2021-01-01'

# Get the data for a specific stock symbol
symbol = 'AAPL'
df = pdr.get_data_yahoo(symbol, start=start_date, end=end_date)

# Calculate the MACD indicator
macd = MACD(close=df["Close"])
df['macd'] = macd.macd()
df['macd_signal'] = macd.macd_signal()
df['macd_diff'] = macd.macd_diff()

# Display the data
print(df[['Close', 'macd', 'macd_signal', 'macd_diff']])
```

This script uses the `pdr.get_data_yahoo()` function to retrieve stock price data for a specific symbol (in this case, `AAPL` for Apple Inc.) over a specified date range. The data is returned as a `pandas` DataFrame.

The `ta.MACD` class from the `ta` package is then used to calculate the MACD indicator for the stock price data. This class takes the closing price data as input and calculates the MACD line, signal line, and histogram (i.e., the difference between the MACD line and signal line).

The resulting MACD data is added to the DataFrame as new columns and can be accessed and used in your analysis.

Is there anything else you'd like to know or do with this script? ðŸ˜Š
